## WhatsApp Bot In Javascript Baileys Web API

Xstro WhatsApp Bot is powered by the open-source [WhatsApp Web API](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys), which allows for automated interactions with WhatsApp. This bot enables you to send and receive messages, manage contacts, and perform various actions directly through Baileys to simplify tasks.

### Warning

I’m not responsible for you messing around and getting your account banned. As long as you don’t modify the source code to fit your idiotic needs, you’re fine. Seriously, don’t spam others—I'm tired of repeating this.
